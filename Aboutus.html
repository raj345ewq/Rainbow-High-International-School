        <p>I feel indeed privileged and proud to invite you to the website which stands as a threshold of Rainbow High to enable us to spread our goals as per 
            the rapidly changing pedagogical practices in school education.
            I am confident that with the combined efforts of our hard working and dedicated employees, stakeholders, blessings and guidance of our patrons,
            we will continue to evolve consistently.Though the enormity of the task is certainly challenging, what stands out in Rainbow High is the quality of its service
            endered in the growth of the personality of its students. We all have been leading our offices to the best of our capability, though the challenges
            are still increasing. The biggest challenge is providing quality Education to children who have been entrusted to us. I understand that Education 
            is not confined to academics alone. It is indeed our responsibility to cater to the development of Physical, Mental, Social, Cultural and Spiritual
            aspects of the children. And I am sure we will do our best in the noble cause of strengthening the nation.</p>

        <p>  Dear friends, I welcome you to our school, a premier institution in Bangalore, the nerve centre of the Karnataka. During the half a
             century of our existence since 1965, we have served the nation by developing the young human resource by providing the ambience of freedom, 
             equity and joy to our children to grow on their own to realize their full potential. We believe if at all India is to actualize its dream of 
             becoming a developed nation, our schools must lay the foundation of life-long education, independent of the formal institutions. With this
              in mind, we aim to enable our students to learn to learn, to ignite their minds and make them open the doors to vistas of knowledge. 
              We also reach out our parents for fresh ideas and thoughts as the school is for both the children and their parents and the society 
              at large. In this spirit, we have served our stakeholders and wish to continue in the years ahead. On this occasion, I call upon the
              parents and members of the society, especially our ex-students to join us in our humble efforts.</p>

        <p >Today, Rainbow high International School has become a role model. Due to the unparalleled contribution of our teachers, Rainbow high has established an unique 
            identity in all its activities. The flame of learning remained intact despite the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the academic session
             was not let to be impeded by any circumstances.
            A child's most valuable years are spent in school. Our teachers are entrusted with the pivotal task of shaping the future of more than four thousand students in
            two campuses during their formative years. With better training for the teachers and excellent infrastructure facilities, Rainbow high strives to build 
            a sense of Indianness along with their holistic development as its singular focus. By offering a variety of activities in school, self-reliance is fostered among students.
            The Rainbow high International School today is shaped by the excellent contributions of our present and former teachers. I firmly believe that this service and 
            dedication will continue uninterrupted.</p>
